# I kinda hate this chapter 6

This chapter is full on building data pipeline in Apache Nifi. Which the author not only forgot to mention the little important steps, but also the UI of Kibana in author's machine was the older that current version. Making it very difficult and struggle to follow.

To summarize, I hate this chapter.
